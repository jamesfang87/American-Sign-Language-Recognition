#Version Information and Future Work
Versions 1-3 are purely implementations of Wang et al. 2012. Version 3 is the final version while versions 1-2 are "snapshots" of the code at certain points in implementation.
Currently, I am working on creating version 4: which extends past the work done by Wang et al. by doing "real-life" testing. Version 5 will include subsequence matching.
